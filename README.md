# Geocam
Geo-cam allows you to click geomap-watermarked photos and save them to your gallery.

It saves the original image as well as the watermarked image. Most geo tag apps are very slow and have a lot of ads. This app is made to work faster than the typical geotag apps. It will also be open source and not have any ads.
